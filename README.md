> ✅ *Mastering design patterns leads to cleaner, more reusable, and efficient software architecture!*

## 📖 Introduction  
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They improve code reusability, maintainability, and scalability by providing structured approaches to problem-solving.  

## 🏗️ 1. Creational Patterns (Object Creation)  
These patterns focus on object instantiation while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.  

- **Abstract Factory** → Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
- **Builder** → Constructs complex objects step-by-step for better readability and flexibility.  
- **Factory Method** → Defines an interface for object creation, allowing subclasses to determine the actual implementation.  
- **Prototype** → Creates new objects by copying an existing instance (useful for expensive object creation).  
- **Singleton** → Ensures only one instance of a class exists globally.  

## 🏛️ 2. Structural Patterns (Class & Object Composition)  
These patterns simplify the design by organizing object relationships efficiently.  

- **Adapter (Composition & Inheritance)** → Converts one interface to another to enable compatibility.  
- **Bridge** → Decouples abstraction from implementation, allowing independent modifications.  
- **Composite** → Treats individual objects and groups of objects uniformly (tree structure).  
- **Decorator** → Dynamically adds new behavior to objects without altering existing code.  
- **Facade** → Provides a simple interface for complex subsystems.  
- **Flyweight** → Reduces memory usage by sharing common object instances.  
- **Proxy** → Controls access to an object, often used for security or performance optimizations.  

## 🎭 3. Behavioral Patterns (Object Interaction)  
These patterns focus on communication between objects and define workflows.  

- **Chain of Responsibility** → Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.  
- **Command** → Encapsulates requests as objects, enabling undo/redo functionality.  
- **Interpreter** → Defines a language grammar and an interpreter to process expressions.  
- **Iterator** → Provides a way to sequentially access elements without exposing the underlying structure.  
- **Mediator** → Centralizes communication between objects to reduce dependencies.  
- **Memento** → Captures an object’s state to restore it later (useful for undo mechanisms).  
- **Observer** → Establishes a one-to-many dependency where observers get notified of state changes.  
- **State** → Allows an object to change its behavior when its state changes.  
- **Strategy** → Defines interchangeable algorithms that can be selected dynamically.  
- **Template Method** → Defines a skeleton for an algorithm, allowing subclasses to modify specific steps.  
- **Visitor** → Adds new operations to an object structure without modifying its classes.
